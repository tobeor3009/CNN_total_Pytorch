# CNN Total Pytorch

This repository contains a collection of various libraries and utility functions for deep learning with Pytorch. and This is a module being used for medical tasks.
  - task
    - Dataset
      - support augmentation
        - use albumentation
    - classification
    - segmentation
    - generation

## Installation Or How to use it.

To be Done. I create custom .ipynb files for each task to use this module, and I haven't uploaded any files yet because the general usage method hasn't been confirmed. If there is a request, I will upload examples of the .ipynb files.
But The files under the 'src/model' directory should be easy to use as they return pytorch Model(nn.Module) objects. If needed, you can directly import and use them in your projects.

## Why should you use this repository?
If you become proficient in handling this code, you can quickly carry out various tasks or experiments just by adjusting parameters.

## Limitation
I am considering creating a web page for documentation because the current documentation for this repository is not well-organized.

## To BE Done
- Make DocString.
- Create Document Page for this repository.
