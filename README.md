# CNN Total PyTorch
This repository contains a collection of various libraries and utility functions for deep learning with PyTorch. It is specifically designed for medical tasks.

--- 
## Features
- **Tasks**:
  - **Dataset**:
    - Supports augmentation using **Albumentations**.
    - Provides data preprocessing utilities for medical imaging datasets.
  - **Classification**:
    - Includes predefined architectures for medical image classification.
  - **Segmentation**:
    - Supports semantic and instance segmentation tasks with flexibility for model customization.
  - **Generation**:
    - Contains tools for generating synthetic medical data, useful for data augmentation and balancing.
  - **Training**:
    - Provides **Jupyter Notebook-based training scripts** for ease of use and reproducibility.

## Installation and Usage
### How to Use
Currently, detailed usage instructions are under development. Custom `.ipynb` files for each task are being created but have not yet been uploaded, as the general usage methodology has not been finalized. If requested, I will upload example `.ipynb` files for demonstration.

For now, the files under the `src/model` directory can be used independently. They return PyTorch `Model` objects (`nn.Module`) and can be directly imported and utilized in your projects.

> **Note:** 
> 1. A script capable of performing **regression multi-task** is located at `scripts/0_regression_multi_task_pft_xray.ipynb`.
> 2. A script capable of performing **segmentation multi-task** is located at `scripts/1_segmentation_multi_task_dp.py`.
> 3. A script capable of performing **CT-Super resoultion Gan** is located at `scripts/2_ct_super_resolution_gan.py`
